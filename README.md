# LiteFarm

LiteFarm is the world’s first community-led, not-for-profit, digital platform joining farmers and scientists together for participatory assessment of social, environmental and economic outputs of farming systems. LiteFarm is the first application of its kind specifically tailored to the needs of diversified farmers with built-in pathways to provide expert decision support and help them earn additional income through payment for ecological services (PES) schemes and in-app certifications (such as organic). These approaches serve the multiple purposes of incentivizing adoption of sustainable land use practices through the provision of evidence-based decision support, and significantly increasing the amount of data being collected by diversified farming operations around the globe. It was developed with farmers at the center of the design process and built from the ground up with accessibility and approachability in mind. We are proud of our mission:

_To meet farmers where they are and equip them with the tools they need to make informed and responsible decisions about the health of their farm, their livelihood, their community, and the planet._

LiteFarm version 1.0.0 was released to the public in July 2020. The LiteFarm app is continually being developed, with farmers, researchers, designers and developers working together to create new localized modules and features into the future. LiteFarm is deployed in Canada, the USA, and Latin America.
